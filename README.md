# OpenLibreAI

## Background

The world needs fine-tuned models for domain specific use-cases to solve domain-specific problems such as image analysis, video analysis, and vector database data analysis.

The inputs to the OpenLibreAI models are raw data.

The output of the OpenLibreAI API (which wrap the OpenLibreAI models) are generated text, images, predictions, summaries and other value-add artifacts.

## Mission

OpenLibreAI is a free and open source platform for AI research and development. It is a community-driven project that aims to provide a platform for AI researchers and developers to collaborate and share their work. 

What the world needs now is an open source AI stack / cloud platform / application platform.

OpenLibreAI is an open source attempt to collect, deploy, and productionize open source models that are useful for pro-human and pro-social use-cases such as healthcare and education.

OpenLibre's models are open source and free to use under an MIT license.

OpenLibre's models would be trained and fine-tuned for domain-specific use-cases.

For example, one can use skin cancer data and images to trains a model to detect skin cancer.

The LibreAI Carcinoma model is trained on open source skin cancer data and images that scientists and researchers have made available to the public (in a hopefully privcy-preserving way).



## OpenLibreAI Collaboration Model and Structure


OpenLibreAI is structured as an open source collective and devs are compensated in proportional-accrued-value-impact-dollars (PAVIDs). PAVIDs are credits, which are pegged to USD so that 1 PAVID = 1 USD.
